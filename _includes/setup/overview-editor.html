  <h3>Editor</h3>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text
    editor that is optimized for writing code, with features
    like automatic color-coding of key words.
    We recommend
    <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 2</a>,
    which is available as a free trial on Mac OS X, Linux
    (and Windows).
