  <h3>Editor</h3>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text
    editor that is optimized for writing code, with features
    like automatic color-coding of key words.
    We recommend
    <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 2</a>,
    which is available as a free trial on Mac OS X, Linux
    (and Windows).
    For editing within the terminal,
    <a href="http://www.nano-editor.org/download.php">nano</a>
    is easy to get started with than most.  (You probably already
    have nano installed; open a terminal, type <code>nano</code>
    and hit enter.  Hold ctrl+x to quit.)
